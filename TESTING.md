# Testing

### Methodology

Manual tests were applied as I was building features to ensure all features added were as fully finished as needed at their respective stages. Any bugs found were either dealt with immediately or noted in READme for future fixing. Validators of affected/changed files /pages were rechecked after each bug fix after initial validation had begun
